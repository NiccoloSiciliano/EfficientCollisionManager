# Optimized Arena Game Engine

## Overview
This project is a **2D game engine** featuring an **optimized collision manager** and a simple arena battle game.  
Two players fight inside an arena by shooting at each other. To survive, they can **build walls** or **deploy shields**.  
The main focus of the engine is on **efficient collision detection**, which ensures smooth gameplay even as the number of objects in the scene grows.

## Game Mechanics
- **Players**  
  - Two human-controlled players battle in an enclosed arena.  
  - Each player can shoot projectiles at the opponent.  
  - Players can build **walls** to block incoming shots or create **shields** for temporary protection.  

- **Arena**  
  - An enclosed space where movement, construction, and shooting take place.  
  - All gameplay interactions (walls, shields, bullets, players) rely on the collision manager for proper detection.

## Optimized Collision Manager
Traditional collision detection checks **all object pairs** in the scene, resulting in a complexity of **O(n²)** for `n` objects.  
This quickly becomes infeasible as the number of objects increases.

To solve this, our collision manager uses a **spatial partitioning technique**:

1. **Grid Partitioning**  
   - The game space is divided into cells of dimension `cell_dim`.  
   - Each object is assigned to every cell it overlaps.  

2. **Cell Storage**  
   - Each cell maintains an **array of objects** that touch it.  
   - To optimize memory and performance, each cell can hold at most `max_num` objects.  

3. **Collision Detection**  
   - Collisions are only checked **within the same cell**, not across all objects in the scene.  
   - The efficiency comes from limiting comparisons to local neighbors.

4. **Complexity Reduction**  
   - The algorithm improves from **O(n²)** to  
     ```
     O(n * max_num * max_dim)
     ```  
     where:  
     - `n` = number of objects  
     - `max_num` = maximum objects per cell (configurable)  
     - `max_dim` = maximum number of cells an object can occupy (much smaller than `n`)  

5. **Scalability**  
   - By tuning `cell_dim` and `max_num`, developers can balance **CPU** and **memory utilization** to meet system requirements.  
   - Larger cells → fewer memory lookups, but more collisions per cell.  
   - Smaller cells → more precise, but higher memory usage.
